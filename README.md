# OpenLayers Project 🌐

Welcome to the OpenLayers Project! 🚀 To get started, follow the steps below:

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have **npm** and **Node.js** installed on your system.

## Setting up the Server
1. Navigate to the `server` directory.
2. Run the following commands:
   ```bash
   npm install
   node service.js
## PostgreSQL Configuration
Ensure that PostgreSQL is running on the same port as specified in the code.

For the PostgreSQL tables, you don't need to worry; the code will handle their creation. Just prepare the database and pass the credentials into the code.
